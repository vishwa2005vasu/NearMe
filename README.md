Kolathur Fish Market is located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. It's known for its vibrant atmosphere and bustling activity, typical of many Indian fish markets. You can find a wide variety of fresh seafood, including fish, prawns, crabs, and more, often directly brought in by local fishermen. These markets are not just places to buy seafood; they're also cultural hubs where people gather to socialize, negotiate prices, and immerse themselves in the local flavors and traditions. If you're a seafood lover visiting Chennai, exploring Kolathur Fish Market can be a fascinating experience.

As of my last update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about an "N4 Beach." It's possible that it's a local name or a recent development that I'm not aware of. Beach names can vary widely depending on the region, and sometimes local names are used more commonly than official ones. If it's a newly established beach or if it's gained popularity after my last update, I wouldn't have information on it. If you could provide more context or details, I'd be happy to try to help further!

        As of my last update, I don't have information on a Rail Museum specifically located in Kolathur. However, there are numerous rail museums across different regions that showcase the history, development, and technology of railways. These museums often feature vintage locomotives, railcars, signaling equipment, and exhibits on the evolution of rail transport. </p>
